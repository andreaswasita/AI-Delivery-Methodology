### 11.7 Consolidation Recommendations

#### Option A: Enhance Repository with AI Value Modelling Components (RECOMMENDED)

**Add to Repository**:
1. **Create new template**: `19-use-case-prioritization-matrix.md`
   - Include Business Value vs Technical Feasibility 2×2 matrix
   - Add scoring rubric for 11 metrics
   - Provide Excel/Miro template for portfolio view

2. **Enhance ROI Shared Module** ([templates/shared-components/roi-financial-analysis.md](templates/shared-components/roi-financial-analysis.md)):
   - Add Section 15: IRR calculation formula
   - Add Section 16: FinOps cost categories
   - Add Section 17: Scalability assessment framework
   - Update Section 8 (TCO) with cloud-specific cost breakdown

3. **Create new shared component**: `templates/shared-components/value-tracking-dashboard.md`
   - Benefit realization timeline
   - Value KPIs dashboard template
   - Quarterly value review framework

4. **Enhance Business Case Template** ([templates/02-business-case.md](templates/02-business-case.md)):
   - Add Section 5.8: Qualitative factors evaluation
   - Add Section 5.9: Intangibles assessment checklist

5. **Enhance Operate/Care Phase Guide** ([guides/operate-care-phase-complete-guide.md](guides/operate-care-phase-complete-guide.md)):
   - Add dedicated FinOps section with Inform-Optimize-Operate cycle
   - Add cloud cost optimization checklist
   - Add value tracking dashboard implementation

**Benefits**:
- Leverages existing repository strength (templates, guides, calculator)
- Fills critical gaps (prioritization, FinOps, scalability)
- Minimal disruption to current structure
- Enhances rather than replaces

**Effort**: ~3-5 days (1 day per new component)

#### Option B: Create Separate AI Value Modelling Module

**Structure**:
```
templates/
  value-modelling/
    01-value-modelling-overview.md
    02-8-step-process.md
    03-prioritization-matrix.md
    04-finops-framework.md
    05-value-tracking.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Keeps AI Value Modelling as distinct discipline
- Easier to maintain separate update cycles
- Clear ownership boundaries

**Drawbacks**:
- Creates potential duplication with existing ROI templates
- Users may not know which approach to use
- More maintenance overhead

**Effort**: ~5-7 days

### 11.8 Integration with AI Governance Approach

When combined with AI Governance Approach (PART A analysis):

| Phase | AI Governance | AI Value Modelling | Repository | Unified Approach |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Discovery** | Problem validation | Steps 1-3 (Define, Baseline, Future) | Business Envisioning + ROI | Discovery + Value Definition |
| **Design** | Solution architecture | Step 4 (Costs) + Step 6 (Qualitative) | Solution Envisioning + Design | Design + TCO Planning |
| **Prepare** | Infrastructure setup | Step 5 (ROI Analysis) + Step 7 (Prioritize) | Setup Platform + Business Case | Prepare + Value Approval |
| **Adopt** | Deployment + training | Step 8 (Track) starts | Build + Test + Deploy | Adopt + Initial Value Tracking |
| **Sustain** | Continuous improvement | Step 8 (Track & Iterate) continuous | Operate/Care + FinOps | Sustain + Value Optimization |

**Unified Framework** = AI Governance phases + AI Value Modelling embedded at each stage + Repository templates & tools

### 11.9 Alignment Summary

| Dimension | Alignment Score | Readiness |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **8-Step Process Coverage** | 🟢 85% | High - Most steps have repository equivalents |
| **11 Metrics Coverage** | 🟢 82% | High - 9/11 metrics covered by calculator/templates |
| **FinOps Integration** | 🟡 65% | Medium - Has value tracking but not cloud-specific |
| **Prioritization Framework** | 🔴 60% | Low - Missing 2×2 matrix and scoring rubric |
| **Overall Value Modelling Alignment** | 🟢 **78%** | **High** - Strong foundation, key gaps identifiable |

**Conclusion**: Repository has strong value analysis capabilities through ROI calculator and templates but lacks systematic portfolio prioritization and FinOps-specific practices. Adding 5 targeted enhancements (Option A) would achieve 95%+ alignment.
