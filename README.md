# AI Delivery Methodology
## Microsoft AI Frontier - Vision to Value Approach

## Overview
This repository contains comprehensive templates, guides, and documentation for delivering AI projects following Microsoft's AI Frontier delivery methodology. The methodology covers the complete lifecycle from **Vision to Value** with 360° governance, execution strategy, outcomes focus, and continuous change management.

## 🎯 Methodology Phases

### **Vision to Value → Discovery → Prototype → Deploy → Scale **

The methodology follows a structured approach with clear phase gates and outcomes-driven milestones:

1. **Pre-sales & Discovery** - Qualify opportunities and understand requirements
2. **Mobilise and Initiate** - Set up the project foundation
3. **Hackathons (Prototype)** - Rapid prototyping and validation
4. **Setup Platform** - Set the platform, infrastructure components for build
5. **Build** - Build the solution
6. **Integrate** - Integrate the solution with the rest of ecosystem
7. **Test & Evaluate** - Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
8. **Prepare and Deploy** - Production deployment and scaling
9. **Operate and Care** - Ongoing operations and optimization

Underpinned by **360° Governance and Execution, Strategy, Ops Planning and Change Management**
