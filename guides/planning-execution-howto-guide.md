---

## 5. How to Scale from Pilot to Portfolio

### The 3-Phase Scaling Model

**Phase 1: Prove (First 90 Days)**
- Objective: Demonstrate value with one use case
- Success: Working solution, validated ROI, executive support
- Team: 5-8 people

**Phase 2: Grow (Months 4-12)**
- Objective: Scale to 2-3 use cases, build platform
- Success: Reusable platform, faster delivery, CoE established
- Team: 10-15 people

**Phase 3: Transform (Year 2-3)**
- Objective: Enterprise-wide adoption, 10-15 use cases
- Success: AI-first culture, strategic advantage, portfolio delivering 5-10x ROI
- Team: 20-25 people

---

### Scaling Patterns

**Pattern 1: Sequential Scaling**
```
UC1 → UC2 → UC3 → UC4...
(Complete one before starting next)
```
- **Pros:** Low risk, focused execution
- **Cons:** Slow time to value, resource intensive
- **When:** Limited team, high complexity

**Pattern 2: Parallel Scaling**
```
UC1 + UC2 + UC3 (simultaneously)
```
- **Pros:** Fast time to value, portfolio effects
- **Cons:** High resource needs, coordination complexity
- **When:** Large team, proven platform, related use cases

**Pattern 3: Hybrid Scaling** (Recommended)
```
UC1 → (UC2 + UC3) → (UC4 + UC5 + UC6)
(Build platform first, then accelerate)
```
- **Pros:** Balanced risk and speed
- **Cons:** Requires platform thinking
- **When:** Most enterprise scenarios

---

### Reusability and Leverage

**What to Reuse:**

**Infrastructure (80% reusable)**
- Azure ML workspace and configuration
- Networking and security setup
- Monitoring and logging
- CI/CD pipelines

**Platform (60% reusable)**
- Data pipelines (patterns and frameworks)
- Feature engineering libraries
- Model serving infrastructure
- MLOps workflows

**Code (30-40% reusable)**
- Data preprocessing functions
- Evaluation frameworks
- Deployment scripts
- Testing frameworks

**Process (90% reusable)**
- Project templates and checklists
- Governance frameworks
- Review processes
- Training materials

**Expected Acceleration:**
- Use Case 2: 30-40% faster than UC1
- Use Case 3: 40-50% faster than UC1
- Use Cases 4+: 50-60% faster than UC1

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Starting Too Big

**Problem:** "Let's implement AI across the entire organization at once"

**Why it fails:**
- Overwhelming scope
- No proven platform
- Unclear value
- High risk

**How to avoid:**
- ✅ Start with single use case (90 days)
- ✅ Prove value before scaling
- ✅ Build reusable platform
- ✅ Use Fast-Track approach

---

### Pitfall 2: Insufficient Executive Engagement

**Problem:** "The team will figure it out without executive involvement"

**Why it fails:**
- Decisions take too long
- Resources not allocated
- Blockers not removed
- Value not communicated

**How to avoid:**
- ✅ Weekly executive checkpoints (Month 1-2)
- ✅ Bi-weekly demos showing progress
- ✅ Monthly steering committee
- ✅ Clear escalation path
- ✅ Use [Executive Coaching Guide](../guides/executive-coaching-guide.md)

---

### Pitfall 3: Neglecting Change Management

**Problem:** "If we build it, they will use it"

**Why it fails:**
- User adoption <50%
- Value not realized
- Solution abandoned

**How to avoid:**
- ✅ Involve users from Week 1
- ✅ Regular user testing (Weeks 4, 6, 9)
- ✅ Training plan from Week 10
- ✅ Adoption metrics tracked
- ✅ User champions identified

---

### Pitfall 4: Perfectionism Over Progress

**Problem:** "We need 99% accuracy before deploying"

**Why it fails:**
- Misses deployment window
- Over-engineering
- Perfect is the enemy of good

**How to avoid:**
- ✅ Define "good enough" threshold (e.g., 85% accuracy)
- ✅ Deploy MVP, iterate in production
- ✅ Use A/B testing
- ✅ Plan Phase 2 enhancements

---

### Pitfall 5: Weak Data Foundations

**Problem:** "We'll figure out data quality later"

**Why it fails:**
- Poor model performance
- Delayed timelines
- Rework required

**How to avoid:**
- ✅ Data assessment in Week 1
- ✅ Data quality checks automated
- ✅ Data governance from Day 1
- ✅ Use [Data Assessment Report Template](../templates/10-data-assessment-report.md)

---

### Pitfall 6: No Platform Thinking

**Problem:** "Each use case builds from scratch"

**Why it fails:**
- No leverage or reusability
- Expensive to scale
- Inconsistent quality

**How to avoid:**
- ✅ Platform mindset from UC1
- ✅ Document reusable components
- ✅ Centralized MLOps
- ✅ CoE owns platform
- ✅ Use [AI Scaling Patterns Guide](../guides/ai-scaling-patterns-guide.md)

---

### Pitfall 7: Ignoring Operations

**Problem:** "We'll worry about operations after deployment"

**Why it fails:**
- No support model
- Production issues
- Model drift undetected

**How to avoid:**
- ✅ Operations plan from Week 10
- ✅ Monitoring configured before go-live
- ✅ Runbooks documented
- ✅ Handover to ops team (Week 12)
- ✅ Use [Operate & Care Phase Checklist](../checklists/operate-care-phase-checklist.md)
