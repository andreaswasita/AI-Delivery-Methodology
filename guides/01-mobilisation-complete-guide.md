## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is Mobilisation & Initiation?

The Mobilisation & Initiation phase is the first and most critical phase of the AI Frontier delivery methodology. This phase establishes the foundation for project success by:

- Securing executive commitment and funding
- Assembling the right team
- Establishing clear objectives and success criteria
- Setting up governance structures
- Creating the technical foundation
- Engaging stakeholders effectively

**Duration**: Typically 2-4 weeks depending on project complexity and organizational readiness

**Outcome**: A fully mobilised project team with clear direction, approved budget, established governance, and readiness to begin discovery.

---

### 1.2 Why is This Phase Important?

**Statistics show that**:
- 70% of project failures can be traced back to inadequate planning and mobilisation
- Projects with strong executive sponsorship are 2.5x more likely to succeed
- Clear success criteria increase project success rates by 40%
- Proper team mobilisation reduces time-to-value by 30%

**This phase sets the tone for**:
- Executive confidence in the project
- Team alignment and motivation
- Stakeholder engagement levels
- Technical foundation quality

### 4.2 WEEK 2: Planning & Governance

#### Week 2 Activities: Business Case & Detailed Planning

**Business Case Development (3-5 days)**

**Step 1: Problem Quantification**
- Gather current state data
- Quantify pain points
- Calculate current costs
- Measure current performance
- Document baseline metrics

**Step 2: Solution Definition**
- Define AI approach at high level
- Identify Azure services needed
- Define integration points
- Describe MVP scope
- Outline phased approach

**Step 3: Benefits Analysis**
- Identify all benefits (tangible/intangible)
- Quantify each benefit
- Create 5-year projection
- Document assumptions
- Consider timing of benefit realization

**Example Benefit Calculation:**
```
Current State: 
- 10 FTE @ $100K = $1M annually
- Manual processing time: 40 hours/week

AI Solution Impact:
- Automate 60% of work
- Save 24 hours/week FTE time
- = 6 FTE equivalent = $600K annually

Year 1: 50% of benefit realized = $300K
Year 2-5: 100% of benefit = $600K/year
5-year benefit = $2.7M
```

**Step 4: Cost Estimation**

**Development Costs:**
- Project team time (FTEs × Duration × Rate)
- External consultants (if any)
- Software/tools

**Example:**
```
6-month project, team of 8 @ average $150K salary
Development cost = 8 × 0.5 year × $150K = $600K
```

**Infrastructure Costs (Azure):**
- Compute (Azure ML, VMs)
- Storage (Data Lake, Blob)
- AI Services (Cognitive Services, OpenAI)
- Networking
- Monitoring

**Estimation Approach:**
- Use Azure Pricing Calculator
- Factor in dev, test, prod environments
- Include data egress costs
- Add 20% buffer for unknowns

**Operational Costs:**
- Support team (0.5-1 FTE)
- Ongoing Azure consumption
- Model retraining
- Maintenance and enhancements

**Step 5: Financial Analysis**
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100

Example:
5-year benefits: $2.7M
5-year costs: $1.2M
ROI = ($2.7M - $1.2M) / $1.2M × 100 = 125%

Payback Period:
Year 0: -$600K (investment)
Year 1: +$300K (cumulative: -$300K)
Year 2: +$600K (cumulative: +$300K)
Payback = ~1.5 years
```

**Step 6: Risk Assessment**
- Identify top 5-7 risks
- Quantify potential impact
- Show mitigation plans
- Adjust financial projections if needed

**Step 7: Alternatives Analysis**
- Option 1: Do nothing (baseline)
- Option 2: Non-AI solution
- Option 3: Recommended AI solution
- Compare on cost, benefit, risk, timing

**Step 8: Review & Approval**
- Finance review
- Technology review
- Legal review (if needed)
- Business Owner review
- Executive approval

---

**Governance Setup (2-3 days)**

**RACI Matrix Creation:**
1. List all key activities by phase
2. List all roles
3. Assign RACI for each activity
   - R (Responsible): Does the work
   - A (Accountable): Ultimately answerable (only ONE)
   - C (Consulted): Provides input
   - I (Informed): Kept updated

**Common RACI Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Multiple "A"s for one activity
- ❌ No "A" assigned
- ❌ Too many "C"s (consultation overload)
- ❌ Missing "I"s for critical stakeholders

**Governance Structure:**
```
Executive Sponsor
      |
Steering Committee (monthly)
      |
Project Manager
      |
Core Project Team (weekly)
      |
Extended Team / Workstreams
```

**Decision Framework:**
- Strategic decisions: Executive Sponsor
- Scope decisions: Steering Committee
- Technical decisions: AI Lead + Solution Architect
- Budget decisions: Executive Sponsor + Finance
- Operational decisions: Project Manager

---

**Risk Register Creation (1-2 days)**

**Risk Identification Techniques:**
1. **Brainstorming**: Team workshop
2. **Historical Review**: Past project lessons
3. **Expert Interviews**: Talk to AI experts
4. **Checklists**: Use AI project risk checklists
5. **Assumption Analysis**: Challenge each assumption

**Risk Categories:**
- Technical (model performance, integration, scalability)
- Data (quality, availability, privacy)
- Business (requirements, adoption, value)
- Organizational (resources, expertise, politics)
- External (vendors, regulations, technology changes)

**Risk Assessment:**
```
Probability Scale:
5 = Very High (>80%)
4 = High (60-80%)
3 = Medium (40-60%)
2 = Low (20-40%)
1 = Very Low (<20%)

Impact Scale:
5 = Critical (project failure)
4 = High (major disruption)
3 = Medium (moderate impact)
2 = Low (minor impact)
1 = Very Low (negligible)

Risk Score = Probability × Impact

Priority:
20-25 = Critical (immediate action)
15-19 = High (urgent attention)
10-14 = Medium (monitor closely)
5-9 = Low (monitor)
1-4 = Very Low (accept)
```

**For each significant risk:**
- Describe clearly
- Identify root cause
- Assess probability and impact
- Assign owner
- Define mitigation strategy (reduce likelihood)
- Define contingency plan (reduce impact if it occurs)
- Identify trigger indicators (early warning signs)
- Assign mitigation actions with due dates
