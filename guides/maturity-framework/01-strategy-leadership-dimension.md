## 1. Dimension Overview

### 1.1 What Strategy & Leadership Measures

The **Strategy & Leadership** dimension assesses your organization's strategic clarity, executive commitment, and governance structures for AI initiatives. This dimension evaluates:

- **AI Vision & Strategy**: Clarity of AI ambition and strategic alignment
- **Executive Sponsorship**: Active support and commitment from C-level leaders
- **Governance Structures**: Decision-making frameworks and oversight mechanisms
- **Strategic Investment**: Budget commitment and resource allocation
- **Organizational Alignment**: Cross-functional coordination and stakeholder engagement

### 1.2 Key Indicators

**Strong Strategy & Leadership (Score 4.0+):**
- ✅ Clear 3-5 year AI vision documented and communicated
- ✅ Executive sponsor actively engaged (weekly/bi-weekly touchpoints)
- ✅ AI Steering Committee with C-level representation
- ✅ Multi-year budget commitment secured
- ✅ AI integrated into corporate strategic planning

**Weak Strategy & Leadership (Score <2.5):**
- ❌ No formal AI strategy or roadmap
- ❌ Opportunistic projects without strategic coordination
- ❌ Limited executive engagement beyond initial approval
- ❌ Project-by-project funding (no sustained investment)
- ❌ AI treated as IT initiative, not business transformation

---

## 2. Why Strategy & Leadership Matters

### 2.1 Impact on AI Success

**Research Shows:**
- **70% of AI project failures** trace back to inadequate executive sponsorship (PMI, 2023)
- Organizations with active executive sponsors are **2.5x more likely** to achieve ROI targets (Gartner, 2024)
- Clear AI strategy increases project success rate by **40%** (McKinsey, 2023)
- Strategic alignment reduces time-to-value by **30%** (Accenture, 2024)

**Why It's Critical:**
1. **Resource Allocation** - Without executive commitment, AI initiatives get de-prioritized
2. **Org Change** - AI transformation requires cross-functional change; execs must drive it
3. **Risk Tolerance** - Executives set appetite for experimentation and acceptable failure rates
4. **Strategic Bets** - Major AI investments need C-level approval and sustained support

### 2.2 Common Failure Modes

**"AI Tourism"** - Symptom of Low Strategy Maturity
- Organization launches AI pilots without strategic intent
- Projects selected based on technology novelty, not business value
- No clear path from pilot to production or scale
- **Result:** Wasted investment; pilot purgatory

**"Fragmented AI"** - Symptom of Weak Governance
- Multiple business units pursue AI independently
- Redundant efforts; missed synergies
- Inconsistent standards and practices
- **Result:** Higher costs; integration nightmares

**"The Vanishing Sponsor"** - Symptom of Weak Executive Engagement
- Executive approves project but disappears afterward
- No air cover when project faces obstacles
- Loses funding when priorities shift
- **Result:** Project cancellation or failure

## 7. Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: "The Disappearing Sponsor"

**Symptom:** Executive approves AI project but then becomes unavailable; delegates all decisions to subordinates.

**Root Causes:**
- Sponsor didn't understand time commitment
- AI is one of 20 priorities; gets deprioritized
- Sponsor lacks AI understanding; feels uncomfortable engaging

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Set clear expectations upfront (2-4 hours/month minimum)
- ✅ Create sponsor enablement program (monthly briefings)
- ✅ Develop executive dashboard for quick visibility
- ✅ Schedule recurring touchpoints (don't rely on ad-hoc)
- ✅ If sponsor consistently unavailable, escalate to CEO for new sponsor

---

### Challenge 2: "Strategy on a Shelf"

**Symptom:** AI strategy document exists but doesn't drive decisions; everyone ignores it.

**Root Causes:**
- Strategy created in isolation; no stakeholder buy-in
- Strategy too vague or aspirational; not actionable
- No accountability for executing strategy
- Strategy not integrated into governance or planning

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Co-create strategy with stakeholders (not top-down)
- ✅ Make strategy specific and actionable (clear priorities, timelines)
- ✅ Link strategy to budget decisions (funded initiatives must align)
- ✅ Integrate into steering committee agendas (monthly review)
- ✅ Tie executive performance goals to strategy execution

---

### Challenge 3: "Governance Theater"

**Symptom:** Steering committee exists but is rubber-stamp; no real decisions made; low attendance.

**Root Causes:**
- No clear decision rights or authority
- Meetings are information-only (no decisions to make)
- Wrong people in the room (not decision-makers)
- No preparation; meetings are ad-hoc and unfocused

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Define clear decision rights and authority levels
- ✅ Create decision-forcing agenda (explicit decisions each meeting)
- ✅ Ensure right people attend (decision-makers, not delegates)
- ✅ Send pre-reads 48 hours before meeting
- ✅ Document decisions and hold people accountable

---

### Challenge 4: "Project-to-Project Funding Death Spiral"

**Symptom:** Every AI project requires new business case and funding approval; no sustained investment.

**Root Causes:**
- AI seen as "nice to have" not strategic
- CFO treats AI like any other IT project
- No program-level business case; only project-level
- Risk aversion; want to see results before investing more

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Develop program-level business case (portfolio ROI)
- ✅ Demonstrate quick wins to build credibility
- ✅ Benchmark against competitors (risk of falling behind)
- ✅ Secure multi-year commitment (even if annual review)
- ✅ Show cost of NOT investing in AI capability

---

## 8. Success Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Start with Why"

**What:** Articulate compelling business rationale for AI before jumping to use cases

**How:**
- Facilitate "Five Whys" sessions to understand root business challenges
- Map AI capability to business strategy and goals
- Create narrative: "We need AI because..."
- Test narrative with business leaders (does it resonate?)

**Impact:** Creates shared understanding and commitment

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "We should use AI because everyone else is"
- ✅ Good: "We need AI to reduce customer churn by 30% because retention drives 60% of our revenue growth"

---

### Pattern 2: "Show, Don't Tell"

**What:** Use quick pilots to demonstrate AI value tangibly to executives

**How:**
- Select high-visibility, low-complexity use case
- Deliver working demo in 4-6 weeks
- Quantify business impact (even if small scale)
- Present results to executive sponsor and steering committee

**Impact:** Builds executive confidence and commitment

**Example:**
- Pilot fraud detection model that catches $500K in fraud in first month
- Executive now believes AI works; more willing to fund expansion

---

### Pattern 3: "Executive Coaching, Not Just Updates"

**What:** Proactively build executive AI literacy and strategic thinking

**How:**
- Use [Executive Coaching Guide](../90-executive-coaching-guide.md) framework
- Monthly executive learning sessions (30 min)
- Share industry AI trends and competitor intelligence
- Invite executives to AI demos and workshops
- Create executive AI advisory group (peer learning)

**Impact:** Executives become AI champions, not just approvers

---

### Pattern 4: "Governance with Teeth"

**What:** Make governance real by giving steering committee real decisions to make

**How:**
- Present clear decision points: "We need your approval on X"
- Show trade-offs and alternatives (not just recommendations)
- Create portfolio view: "Here's what we can do with current budget; what should we prioritize?"
- Follow up on decisions; show impact of their choices

**Impact:** Executives feel ownership and accountability
