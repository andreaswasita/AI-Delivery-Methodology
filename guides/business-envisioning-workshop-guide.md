- Review agenda and timing
- Establish ground rules:
  - Be present (devices away unless needed for workshop)
  - Build on ideas (yes, and... not yes, but...)
  - Challenge ideas, not people
  - Respect time boxes
  - Use parking lot for off-topic items

**[25-30 min] Ice Breaker**

> "Share a recent experience where technology (any technology, not just AI) made your work significantly easier or harder. What happened?"

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Set positive, energetic tone
- Model vulnerability in sharing
- Watch for disengaged participants and draw them in
- Start the parking lot immediately when tangents emerge

**[30-50 min] Vision Statement Co-Creation**
Facilitate group exercise to create vision statement:

**Framework Template:**
> "By leveraging AI, we will [**transform/improve/enable**] [**what aspect of business**] so that [**stakeholders**] can [**achieve what outcome**], resulting in [**measurable impact**]."

**Process:**
1. Individual silent writing (5 min): Everyone drafts their version
2. Small group sharing (10 min): Groups of 3-4 share and combine best elements
3. Group share-out (5 min): Each group shares their version
4. Collective refinement (10 min): Facilitator helps synthesize one statement

**Example Vision Statements:**
- *"By leveraging AI-powered analytics, we will transform our supply chain operations so that our planning teams can predict demand with 95% accuracy, resulting in 20% reduction in inventory costs and 30% improvement in on-time delivery."*
- *"By leveraging generative AI, we will enable our customer service team to resolve inquiries 3x faster so that customers receive 24/7 personalized support, resulting in 40-point NPS improvement."*

**[50-60 min] Vision Validation**
Test the vision statement:
- Does it connect to strategic priorities?
- Is it specific enough to guide decisions?
- Is it ambitious yet achievable?
- Does it resonate with all stakeholders?

**Facilitator Tips:**

- Connected to business outcomes
- Actionable and solvable

**Poor Problem Statement:**
> "Our customer service is slow."

**Good Problem Statement:**
> "Our customer service team takes an average of 48 hours to respond to product inquiries, resulting in 30% cart abandonment rate and $2M annual revenue loss. Root cause: agents spend 60% of time searching for product information across 5 disconnected systems."

**[10-40 min] Problem Identification Exercise**
**Round 1 - Silent Brainstorm (10 min):**
Each participant writes down business problems on sticky notes:
- One problem per note

- Common themes: Process Inefficiency, Customer Experience, Decision Making, Compliance, Innovation

**[40-75 min] Deep Dive on Top Problems**
Select top 3-5 problems (highest stars + strategic alignment)

For each problem, facilitate structured discussion:

**Problem Statement (10 min per problem):**
1. **What is the problem?** - Observable issue
2. **Who does it affect?** - Stakeholders impacted
3. **When/where does it occur?** - Context and frequency
4. **Why does it matter?** - Business impact
5. **What's the root cause?** - Underlying reasons
6. **What have you tried?** - Past attempts

**Impact Quantification Template:**
| Impact Area | Current State | Target State | Gap/Opportunity |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Cost | $X per month | $Y per month | Save $Z |
| Time | X hours | Y hours | Save Z hours |
| Quality | X% error rate | Y% error rate | Improve Z% |
| Revenue | $X lost | $Y captured | Gain $Z |

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Push for specificity and data
- Ask "How do you know?" to uncover assumptions
- Watch for symptoms vs. root causes

- Timeline to production

**[10-30 min] Individual Scoring**
Distribute all use cases to participants

Each person scores use cases independently:

**Scoring Rubric (1-5 scale):**

**Value Score:**

- Strategic Alignment (1-5): How well does this support strategy?
- Urgency (1-5): How pressing is this problem?
- Scale (1-5): How many people/processes affected?
**Total Value = Sum of above (Max 20)**

**Effort Score:**
- Technical Complexity (1-5): How hard to build? (5 = very hard)
- Data Readiness (1-5): Do we have the data? (5 = no data)
- Integration Complexity (1-5): How many systems to integrate? (5 = many)
- Timeline (1-5): How long to production? (5 = >12 months)
**Total Effort = Sum of above (Max 20)**

**[30-45 min] Consensus Scoring**
Facilitator aggregates individual scores:

- Plot each use case on 2x2 matrix
- Discuss outliers (scores with high variance)
- Build consensus through structured dialogue

**Priority Quadrants:**
- **Quick Wins** (High Value, Low Effort): Start here!
- **Strategic Bets** (High Value, High Effort): Plan carefully
- **Fill-Ins** (Low Value, Low Effort): Do if resources allow
- **Money Pits** (Low Value, High Effort): Avoid or defer

**[45-60 min] Roadmap Sequencing**
Create initial roadmap:

**Phase 1 - Proof of Concept (0-3 months):**
- Select 1-2 Quick Wins for rapid validation
- Build confidence and capability

- Deploy Quick Wins to limited production
- Start 1 Strategic Bet
- Gather learnings and refine

**Phase 3 - Scale (6-12 months):**
- Scale successful pilots
- Deliver Strategic Bets
- Build sustainable operations

**Consider Dependencies:**
- Do any use cases depend on others?
- Are there shared data or infrastructure needs?
- Which use cases build team capability for later ones?

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Data-driven but not dictated by scores
- Make trade-offs transparent
- Get explicit commitment from executive sponsor
- Document assumptions and risks
- Validate with technical feasibility
