## 📋 Executive Summary

### What is an AI Academy?

An **AI Academy** is an internal training organization designed to:
- **Build AI literacy** across all organizational levels
- **Develop specialized AI skills** for technical practitioners
- **Certify competency** in AI tools and practices
- **Foster a culture** of continuous learning and innovation
- **Accelerate adoption** of AI technologies
- **Reduce external training costs** through internal capability

### Business Case for AI Academy

**Problem Statement:**
- AI skills shortage costs organizations $500K-$2M annually in lost productivity[^1]
- External AI training costs $2,500-$8,000 per person per course (average $4,200)[^2]
- 84% of organizations cite skills gaps as primary barrier to AI adoption[^3]
- Generic training results in only 30-35% knowledge retention after 6 months[^4]
- Average time-to-competency for AI skills is 9-12 months without structured programs[^5]
- 64% of AI projects fail due to lack of skilled talent and poor training[^6]

**Solution: Internal AI Academy**
