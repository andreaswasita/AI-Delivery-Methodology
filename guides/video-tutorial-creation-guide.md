## 🎙️ Production Best Practices

### Recording Tips

**Audio Quality** (Most Important!):
- ✅ Record in quiet room with minimal echo
- ✅ Use pop filter to reduce plosives
- ✅ Maintain consistent distance from mic
- ✅ Record room tone for noise reduction
- ✅ Test levels (aim for -12dB to -6dB)
- ❌ Don't rely on camera mic
- ❌ Avoid rooms with lots of hard surfaces

**Video Quality**:
- ✅ Film in 1080p minimum (4K if possible)
- ✅ Use 24fps or 30fps consistently
- ✅ Ensure good lighting (avoid backlighting)
- ✅ Frame subject with headroom
- ✅ Use tripod or stable surface
- ❌ Don't film in front of windows
- ❌ Avoid distracting backgrounds

**Screen Recording**:
- ✅ Close unnecessary applications
- ✅ Clean up desktop/browser bookmarks
- ✅ Use high resolution (1920x1080)
- ✅ Zoom in on important areas
- ✅ Slow down cursor movements
- ✅ Use annotations to guide attention
- ❌ Don't include personal information
- ❌ Avoid small text that's hard to read

### Editing Best Practices

**Pacing**:
- Cut out pauses longer than 2 seconds
- Remove filler words ("um," "uh," "like")
- Vary shot types every 5-10 seconds
- Use B-roll to cover edits and maintain interest

**Transitions**:
- Use simple cuts (primary transition)
- Crossfade for section changes (1 second max)
- Avoid flashy transitions that distract
- Match action when cutting between shots

**Music & Sound**:
- Use background music sparingly (low volume, 10-15%)
- Fade music out during important points
- Add sound effects for animations/transitions
- Ensure voiceover is always clear priority

**Captions/Subtitles**:
- ✅ Always include captions (accessibility + engagement)
- ✅ Use 1-2 lines maximum
- ✅ Time captions to speech rhythm
- ✅ Include sound effects in brackets [applause]
- Use YouTube's auto-caption as starting point, then edit
