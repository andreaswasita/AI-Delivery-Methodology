**Instructions for Use:**

1. **Start Early:** Begin this checklist during Business Envisioning, not after technology decisions
2. **Be Honest:** Realistic assessments are better than optimistic assumptions
3. **Involve Stakeholders:** Don't complete this in isolation - engage impacted users
4. **Iterate:** This is a living document - update as you learn more
5. **Use as Gate Criteria:** Don't proceed to implementation without completing critical sections
6. **Track Completion:** Aim for 100% completion before design phase ends

**Typical Completion Time:** 8-12 hours per use case (with stakeholder collaboration)
