## What are OKRs?

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** is a goal-setting framework that helps organizations align teams, focus efforts, and track measurable progress.

- **Objectives:** Qualitative, inspirational goals that define what you want to achieve
- **Key Results:** Quantitative, measurable outcomes that track progress toward the objective

### OKR Principles
- **Ambitious:** Stretch goals that inspire teams (aim for 70% achievement)
- **Measurable:** Clear metrics with specific targets
- **Time-Bound:** Typically set quarterly with annual strategic objectives
- **Transparent:** Visible across organization for alignment
- **Limited:** 3-5 objectives with 3-5 key results each

## OKR Scoring Guide

### Scoring Scale (0.0 - 1.0)

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Red | We failed to make real progress |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | Yellow | Made progress but fell short |
| 0.7 - 1.0 | Green | Success! Achieved or exceeded goal |

### Target Achievement
- **Ideal:** 0.7 - 0.8 average across all OKRs (stretch goals should be hard to fully achieve)
- **Concerning:** < 0.5 (goals may be too ambitious or execution issues)
- **Too Easy:** > 0.9 (goals not ambitious enough, need to raise the bar)

### Scoring Examples

**Key Result:** Achieve 95% customer satisfaction score  
- **Starting:** 80%
- **Target:** 95%
- **Actual:** 90%
- **Progress:** (90 - 80) / (95 - 80) = 10 / 15 = 0.67 (Yellow)

**Key Result:** Launch in 5 new markets  
- **Starting:** 2 markets
- **Target:** 7 markets (2 + 5)
- **Actual:** 5 markets launched
- **Progress:** (5 - 2) / (7 - 2) = 3 / 5 = 0.6 (Yellow)

## OKR Best Practices for AI Projects

### ✅ DO

1. **Align to Business Outcomes:** Connect technical metrics to business value (revenue, cost, satisfaction)
2. **Balance Ambition & Realism:** Stretch goals that are achievable with focused effort
3. **Make Key Results Measurable:** Use specific numbers, percentages, timeframes
4. **Focus on Outcomes, Not Activities:** "Deploy chatbot" ❌ → "Handle 70% of inquiries" ✅
5. **Include Quality Metrics:** Accuracy, fairness, reliability alongside volume/speed
6. **Set Baseline & Target:** Show starting point, target, and actual progress
7. **Limit Number of OKRs:** 3-5 objectives max to maintain focus
8. **Review Frequently:** Weekly/monthly check-ins to course-correct
9. **Celebrate Progress:** Recognize achievements and learnings
10. **Iterate & Improve:** Refine OKR setting based on past quarters

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Avoid Activity-Based OKRs:** "Attend 10 training sessions" is not an outcome
2. **Don't Confuse with Tasks:** OKRs are goals, not project plans or backlogs
3. **Don't Set Too Many:** Spreading focus too thin reduces impact
4. **Don't Make Them Too Easy:** If you always hit 100%, raise the bar
5. **Don't Set & Forget:** OKRs require ongoing attention and adjustment
6. **Don't Punish for Missing Stretch Goals:** 70% is success for ambitious OKRs
7. **Don't Cascade Blindly:** Ensure team OKRs genuinely support company goals
8. **Don't Ignore Qualitative Factors:** Balance metrics with ethical, risk, and quality considerations
