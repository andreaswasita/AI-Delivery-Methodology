- ✅ Put the ask or decision in the first paragraph
- ✅ Use bullet points and visual hierarchy
- ✅ Include expected action and deadline
- ✅ Provide context but keep it concise
- ✅ Use status indicators (🟢🟡🔴) for quick visual reference
- ✅ Attach supporting materials but don't require them to be read
- ✅ Proofread carefully - errors undermine credibility

**Email Communication Don'ts**
- ❌ Write long paragraphs - use bullets and short sentences
- ❌ Bury the lead - put key information first
- ❌ Use jargon or technical acronyms without explanation
- ❌ Send surprises - escalate issues early via phone/meeting
- ❌ Ask open-ended questions - provide specific options
- ❌ Overuse "urgent" or "critical" - reserve for true emergencies
- ❌ Forward long email threads - summarize instead
- ❌ Communicate bad news via email only - call first, then document

**Meeting Communication Best Practices**
1. **Always Have an Agenda**: Send 24-48 hours in advance
2. **Send Pre-reads**: Key materials 2-3 days before for review
3. **Start with Executive Summary**: 2-minute overview of status
4. **Focus on Decisions**: Identify what needs their decision/input
5. **Manage Time**: Stick to agenda, park tangential discussions
6. **Document Decisions**: Send meeting notes within 24 hours
7. **Action Items**: Clear owners and deadlines
8. **End with Next Steps**: What happens next and when
