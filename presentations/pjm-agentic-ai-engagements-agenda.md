**Time:** 0:10 - 0:25

**Objectives:**
- Demystify Agentic AI terminology
- Understand agent architecture for scoping
- Identify project management implications

**Content:**

**2.1 What is Agentic AI?** (5 min)
- **Definition:** AI systems that can plan, act, and adapt autonomously
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Goal-oriented (not just task-oriented)
  - Can break down complex problems
  - Learn from feedback
  - Coordinate with other agents
  - Make decisions with minimal human intervention

- **Real-World Examples:**
  - Customer service agents (end-to-end ticket resolution)
  - DevOps agents (incident detection → diagnosis → fix → deployment)
  - Research agents (literature review → synthesis → recommendations)

**2.2 Agent Architecture Patterns** (5 min)
```
Master Agent (Orchestrator)
    ↓
Specialist Agents (Execution Layer)
├─ Research Agent
├─ Business Analyst Agent
├─ Developer Agent
├─ Test Agent
└─ Security Agent
```

- **PM Implication:** Scope projects by agent capabilities, not just features
- **Scoping Question:** "What agents do we need?" vs "What features do we need?"

**2.3 How Agents Change PM Work** (5 min)
| Traditional PM | Agentic PM |
|----------------|------------|
| Manage people doing tasks | Orchestrate agents + people |
| Sprint planning takes 4 hours | Agents draft plan, PM refines (1 hour) |
| Status updates manual | Agents auto-report progress |
| Risk identification reactive | Agents predict risks proactively |
| 80% admin, 20% strategy | 20% admin, 80% strategy |

**Interactive Activity:**
- Quick Quiz: "Agent or Human?" scenarios
- Discuss: What tasks would you delegate to AI agents?

**Materials Needed:**
- Agent architecture diagram
- PM transformation comparison table

### **Module 3: Pre-Sales - Vision to Business Case** *(20 minutes)*

**Time:** 0:25 - 0:45

**Objectives:**
- Structure AI discovery conversations
- Quantify value and build business cases
- Identify red flags early

**Content:**

**3.1 Discovery Framework** (7 min)
**The 5 Discovery Questions Every PM Must Ask:**

1. **Vision:** "What business problem are we solving?"
   - Not "We want AI" but "We want to reduce churn by 25%"
   - Technique: Five Whys Analysis

2. **Success Metrics:** "How do we measure success?"
   - Must be quantifiable: revenue, cost, time, quality
   - Example: "$2M annual savings" not "better customer service"

3. **Data Reality:** "What data do we have, and what shape is it in?"
   - 80% of AI project time is data prep
   - Red flag: "We have lots of data" but can't describe it
   - Green flag: "Here's our data dictionary and quality report"

4. **Change Readiness:** "Who needs to change how they work?"
   - AI success = Tech adoption + Process change + People buy-in
   - Map stakeholders: Champions, Resisters, Neutrals

5. **Constraints:** "What are our non-negotiables?"
   - Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Budget and timeline realities
   - Technical debt and integrations

**3.2 Value Quantification** (8 min)
**ROI Calculator Walkthrough:**

**Cost Savings Example:**
```
Current State:
- 10 analysts × $80K salary = $800K/year
- Process 5,000 cases/year manually
- Average 4 hours per case = 20,000 hours

With Agentic AI:
- AI handles 70% of cases (3,500 cases)
- Reduces to 1 hour per case
- Saves 10,500 hours = $560K/year
- ROI: 280% in Year 1
```

**Revenue Generation Example:**
```
Current State:
- Sales team closes 100 deals/year
- Average deal size: $50K
- Revenue: $5M/year

With AI Sales Agent:
- Lead qualification 3x faster
- 40% more qualified meetings
- Close rate improves 15%
- New revenue: +$1.05M/year
```

**Tools:**
- ROI Calculator Template (Excel/Web)
- Value Analysis Chatbot
- TCO Worksheet

**3.3 Red Flags & Green Flags** (5 min)

**🚩 Red Flags (Walk Away or Mitigate):**
- "We want AI, but don't know what problem to solve"
- "Our data is too sensitive to share with the PM team"
- "We need this in production in 4 weeks"
- "We can't articulate success metrics"
- "No budget for change management"
- "Executive sponsor is passive"

**✅ Green Flags (High Success Probability):**
- Clear, quantifiable business problem
- Executive sponsor actively engaged
- Data accessible and documented
- Budget includes 20% for change management
- Realistic timeline (6-12 months for production)
- Appetite for iterative approach

**Interactive Activity:**
- **Case Study:** Review 2 scenarios, identify red/green flags
- **Group Discussion:** Share your pre-sales war stories

**Materials Needed:**
- Discovery question template
- ROI calculator (live demo)
- Red/green flags checklist
- Case study handouts
