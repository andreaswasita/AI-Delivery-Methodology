# AI Delivery Methodology: Vision to Value
## A Battle-Tested Framework for Enterprise AI Success

**Presentation Duration:** 5-10 minutes  
**Audience:** Executives, Decision Makers, AI Program Sponsors  
**Purpose:** Introduce the comprehensive AI Delivery Methodology  

---

## Slide 1: The Problem We Solve *(1 minute)*

### The Harsh Reality of AI Projects

> **70% of AI/ML projects never make it to production** *(Gartner)*

### Why AI Projects Fail

Not because of technology—because of **execution failures**:

1. **Strategy Gap**
   - Business vision disconnected from technical implementation
   - Executives and technical teams speak different languages
   - No clear path from idea to value

2. **Execution Gap**
   - No structured approach leads to scope creep
   - Missed expectations and value erosion
   - Projects drift without clear decision gates

3. **Value Gap**
   - AI projects fail to deliver measurable business outcomes
   - ROI unclear or never validated
   - Governance and ethics treated as afterthoughts

**The Challenge:** Most methodologies focus on technology. We focus on the **journey from executive vision to measurable business value**.

---

## Slide 2: Our Unique Approach *(2 minutes)*

### We Start Before the Project Starts

**Pre-Sales & Discovery (1-2 weeks)**

- **50-point opportunity qualification**
  - Business Value (30%)
  - Technical Feasibility (25%)
  - Data Readiness (20%)
  - Client Readiness (15%)
  - Commercial Viability (10%)
  - **Gate:** Must score ≥35/50 to proceed

- **Business-to-AI Strategy Translation**
  - Executive coaching framework with 5 persona strategies
  - 55-point organizational readiness assessment
  - ROI and value analysis with financial projections
  - Five Whys root cause analysis

- **Business Envisioning Workshop**
  - Full-day collaborative session (8-15 stakeholders)
  - Translate vision into actionable use cases
  - Prioritize opportunities by value vs. effort
  - **Gate 1:** Executive approval required

### Value Realization Pattern

```
Investment vs. Value ($M)

50M │                                    ╱ Value
    │                                  ╱
40M │                                ╱
    │                              ╱
30M │                            ╱
    │                          ╱
20M │                        ╱
    │                      ╱
10M │              ╱╱╱╱╱╱
    │      ╱╱╱╱╱╱
 5M │  ▲▲▲▲─────────────────────── Investment
    │▲▲▲▲
  0 │────────────────────────────────
    Q1  Q4    Q8      Q12     Q16   Q20   Q24
```

**Break-even Point:** Typically Month 12-18

**Key Insight:** Investment scales linearly ($500K → $2M → $5M), but value scales exponentially (1x → 1.5x → 5-10x) due to platform leverage and portfolio effects.
